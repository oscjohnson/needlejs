A simple webgl implementation of a cross-stich shader. A project done in the course TNM084 at Link√∂pings University.

Many thanks to Stefan Gustavsson due to his classic noise implementation in GLSL, and also his demo of a cross stitch shader in renderman SL.

The project is dependent on npm to install gulp and express.
